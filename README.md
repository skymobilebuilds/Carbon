## Introduction

Carbon is a library for building component-based user interfaces in UITableView and UICollectionView inspired by [React](https://reactjs.org).  
This make it painless to build and maintain the complex UIs.  

Uses [DifferenceKit](https://github.com/ra1028/DifferenceKit) which is highly optimized based on Paul Heckel's paper for diffing.  
Declarative design and diffing algorithm make your code more predictable, debugging easier and providing beautiful animations to users.  

Our goal is similar to [Instagram/IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit) and [airbnb/Epoxy](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy), we respect those library as pioneers.
